 concastOdds: A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. This should then return as a single array that only has odd numbers, in ascending order from both of the arrays.
 
 Expected inputs concatOdds ([3,2,1], [8,49,5,7,4,15,-1]) to be [-1,1,3,5,7,15,49]
 Expected inputs concatOdds ([4,2,4], [8,2,8,10,4,16,12]) to be ("Error: Please input odd numbers")
 Expected inputs concatOdds ([P,2,4], [8,2,8,k,4,16,12]) to be ("Error: Please only input numbers")
 Expected inputs concatOdds (Hello People) to be ("Error: Please only input numbers")
 
 Functional Test: A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to checkout as a guest (without an account), or as a logged -in user. They should be allowed as well but should be asked if they would like to create an account or log in as guest. -->
 <!-- At checkout it prompts the user with only three options ("Sign in?"), ("Create New Account"), or ("Continue as Guest")-->
  <!--when a user attempts to checkout with nothing in their cart, the user will say ("cart is empty")-->
  <!-- Before the user pays if they are logged in the prompt user will say("would you like to use the card on the account ending in XXXX?")-->
   <!-- Before paying if the user is not logged in the prompt will say to user ("insert to pay")-->
